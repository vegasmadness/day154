# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern static site generator that delivers lightning-fast performance by shipping zero JavaScript by default. It uses a unique "islands architecture" that allows you to use your favorite UI frameworks only when you need interactivity.

## Why Choose Astro?

### Performance First
Astro generates static HTML by default, which means your site loads incredibly fast. JavaScript is only loaded for interactive components, reducing bundle sizes significantly.

### Framework Agnostic
You can use React, Vue, Svelte, or any other framework within the same project. Mix and match as needed!

### Developer Experience
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Hot module replacement
- Built-in optimizations
- Excellent tooling

## Key Features

1. **Zero JavaScript by Default**: Ships only HTML and CSS unless you explicitly need JavaScript
2. **Islands Architecture**: Interactive components are isolated "islands" of interactivity
3. **Framework Flexibility**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or plain HTML/CSS
4. **Built-in Optimizations**: Image optimization, CSS bundling, and more

## Getting Started

```bash
# Create a new Astro project
npm create astro@latest my-project

# Navigate to your project
cd my-project

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Creating Your First Component

Here's a simple Astro component:

```astro
---
// Component script (runs at build time)
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
---

<div class="greeting">
  <h1>{greeting}</h1>
  <p>Welcome to Astro!</p>
</div>

<style>
  .greeting {
    padding: 2rem;
    text-align: center;
  }
</style>
```

## Adding Interactivity

When you need JavaScript, you can add it selectively:

```astro
---
import Counter from './Counter.jsx';
---

<div>
  <h1>Static Content</h1>
  <Counter client:load />
</div>
```

The `client:load` directive tells Astro to hydrate this component on the client side.

## Conclusion

Astro provides an excellent balance between performance and developer experience. Its islands architecture ensures your site stays fast while giving you the flexibility to add interactivity where needed.

Try Astro for your next project and experience the difference!
